### The Titanic dataset

+ Data: http://www.statsci.org/data/general/titanic.txt
+ Description: http://www.statsci.org/data/general/titanic.html
+ Alternate source: http://www.pmean.com/15/images/day2titanic.txt

This dataset is used in the videos.

### R functions introduced in this module

+ addmargins, adds totals to frequency counts
+ cut, divides a continuous variable into categories
+ factor, adds labels to categories represented by numbers
+ geom_bar, add bars to a graph
+ ggsave, saves a graph to a file
+ names, lists names associated with a frequency table
+ paste, combines two or more strings into a single string
+ prop.table, converts counts into proportions
+ range, computes minimum and maximum
+ round, rounds a number
+ scale_y_continuous, defines features for a plot's y-axis
+ sum, adds up all the values
+ table, produces frequency counts and crosstabulations.
+ which, selects rows which meet a logical condition
+ which.max, seletcs row or rows where a maximum occurs
+ which.min, selects row or rows where a minimum occurs

### Your homework

Having completed all the videos in this module, I would like you to turn in some simple analyses that you run on two fresh data sets. This homework assignment will be graded pass/fail.

For every question, include the relevant R output and a brief written commentary explaining what the results mean. When you send your answers, please include the original questions (e.g., Q1: What is the 18th letter of the alphabet. A. The letter "R").

The first four questions relate to the Gardasil dataset, a study of patients who received the Gardasil vaccine. A key question that this dataset was intended to address is what factors influenced whether a patient got all the required shots. More details are given below.

1. Create factors for AgeGroup, Race, Completed. Show frequency counts for all four of these variables.

2. What percentage of patients completed all three shots?

3. Use a crosstabulation to compare Age to AgeGroup. Are the recodings into AgeGroup done properly?

4. Does the likelihood of completing all four shots vary by AgeGroup or Race? Calculate the appropriate percentages.

The next two questions relate to the diet dataset that compares four different types of crackers. The 13 subjects that ate the crackers rated them on the amount of bloating. More details are given below.

5. Calculate frequency tables for both categorical variables in the dataset. Are there any missing values?

6. Calculate a crosstabulation with nicely rounded percentages. Try to arrange the rows and columns and percentages so that your table best addresses the question, what type of cracker had the most and the least bloating.

### Gardasil dataset

The Gardasil vaccine requires three shots in order to be effective. A study conducted at Johns Hopkins looked at how often patients failed to get all three shots. They wanted to see if insurance status, age, and other factors could predict who was at greatest risk for failing to get all three shots.

### How should you read in this file?

The data looks a bit unusual, but the relatively even spacing, except for the first line seems to indicate a tab delimited file. The second format is obviously a comma separated value format. You can tell by the file extension (csv) and by peeking at the file in a text editor.

### Diet dataset

This dataset represents an experiment where 13 volunteers ate four different types of crackers intended for dieters. The volunteers recorded the amount of bloating they experienced after eating each type of cracker. The researchers were interested in a new formulation (gum) that they hoped would be well tolerated.

### How should you read in this file?

The data looks a bit unusual, but the relatively even spacing seems to indicate a tab delimited file. The hint that it is not a fixed width file is in the very first line, where the variable name Cracker does not line up with data directly beneath it.
