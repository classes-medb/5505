This Powerpoint presentation was created using an R Markdown file. This slide shows the version of R that I used and when it was last modified.

### What is longitudinal data
+ Definition
  + Measurements taken at different times
+ Closely related datasets
  + Crossover
  + Pre-test/post-test
  + Repeated measures
  + Split plot
  
<div class="notes">

I'm going to use the term "longitudinal" data to designate data sets where a patient is measured at multiple different time points. This encompasses certain other data sets, such as from a crossover, pre-test/post-test, repeated measures, and split plot.

Don't worry about the technical distinctions among these terms. The important thing to know for now is that longitudinal data represents one of the biggest challenges in data management and we will spend most of this section discussing these challenges.

</div>

### Two formats for longitudinal data
+ Short and fat format
  + Many columns
  + Not so many rows
+ Tall and thin format
  + Not so many columns
  + Many rows
  
<div class="notes">

Longitudinal data usually come in one of two specific formats. The first is the short and fat format and the second is the tall and thin format.

</div>

### Example of both formats
+ Short and fat format
  + http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ctsibrm.txt
+ Tall and thin format
  + http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ctsibuni.txt
+ Look here for context
  + http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ctsib.html

<div class="notes">

Normally, you can only find a dataset stored in one of the two formats, but I did find an example of the same dataset being stored in both formats.

</div>

### Short and fat example

![Longitudinal data stored one row per subject](../images/short-and-fat.png)

<div class="notes">

The short and fat format has one row per patient and each successive patient encounter is strung out horizontally.

</div>

### Tall and thin example

![Longitudinal data stores with multiple rows per patient](../images/tall-and-thin.png)

<div class="notes">

The tall and thin format has one row per patient encounter and therefore multiple rows per patient.

Both formats have advantages and disadvantages, and you need to know how to create a longitudinal file in either format and how to transform from one format to another.

</div>

### Which format is better?

+ Short and fat advantages:
  + easy to compute change scores
  + easy to examine correlations over time
  + easy to insure consistency of demographic data
+ Short and fat disadvantages:
  + hard to read because of the excessive need to scroll left and right

<div class="notes">



</div>

### Which format is better?

+ Tall and thin advantages:
  + easy to plot longitudinal trends
  + less need for missing value codes
  + easy to read because most scrolling is up and down

+ Tall and thin disadvantages
  + hard to maintain consistency of demographic variables

### Energy dataset (short and fat format)

<div class="notes">

Here's another interesting data set that you can work with. It comes in a short and fat format.

### Energy dataset (short and fat format)

```{r read-energy}
fi <- "http://www.statsci.org/data/general/energy.txt"
en <- read.table(fi, header=TRUE)
en
```

<div class="notes">

This dataset is small enough that you can safely print out the entire thing.

You can convert this to a tall and thin format by stacking the running, walking, and cycling values in a single column. You'll need a new variable to remind you whether the value you 

</div>

### Converting to tall and thin

```{r gather-2}
library(tidyr)
en_tall <- gather(en, key="activity", value="energy_used", Running, Walking, Cycling)
head(en_tall, 10)
```

<div class="notes">

Gather creates two new variables. The "key" variable is the name of the column where the data value came from and "value" is the data value itself. Any variable or variables left out of the list are treated like an identifier for a particular row.

</div>

### Lineplot

```{r lineplot}
library(ggplot2)
activity_lineplot <- ggplot(en_tall, aes(x=activity, y=energy_used, group=Subject)) +
  geom_line()
ggsave(
  "../images/activity-by-energy.png", 
  activity_lineplot, width=4, height=4)
```

<div class="notes">

One possible graph that could not have done in the short and fat format is a lineplot. The group parameter in the aes function tells R that separate lines are defined for each subject.

</div>

### Lineplot

![Plot showing activity levels by activity](../images/activity-by-energy.png)

<div class="notes">

Here is the graph. Notice the inverted V shape for each line. This shows that running uses the most energy for any individual subject.

<div class="notes">

Here is a dataset stored in the short and fat format. This dataset will serve as a second example of how to convert from a short and fat format to a tall and thin format.

</div>

### Earthquake dataset

### Earthquake dataset

![View of the earthquake dataset](../images/earthquake-view.png)

<div class="notes">

This is clearly a tab delimited file. All of the fields are left justified.

</div>

### Read in the earthquake data

```{r read-earthquake}
fn <- "http://www.statsci.org/data/general/lomaprie.txt"
qu <- read.table(fn,header=TRUE)
head(qu)
```

<div class="notes">

There are measurements at weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12.

</div>

### Gather

```{r gather}
qu$id <- 1:25
qu_tall <- gather(qu, key="time", value="depression", Week0, Week3, Week6, Week9, Week12)
head(qu_tall)
```

<div class="notes">
 
Suggestion: create an id variable with values 1:25 before you convert the format. It is not needed for the boxplots, but if you do anything more complex with this data, you need to know which data in the tall and thin format comes from the first row of the original data set, from the second row, etc.

</div>

### Boxplot

```{r boxplots}
library(ggplot2)
depression_boxplot01 <- ggplot(qu_tall, aes(x=time, y=depression)) +
  geom_boxplot()
ggsave(
  "../images/time-by-depression01.png", 
  depression_boxplot01, width=4, height=4)
```

<div class="notes">

Notice how R orders the weeks. From a strict alphabetical perspective, week12 is between week0 and week3. Here's a fix.

</div>

### Boxplot

![Boxplots showing depression levels over time](../images/time-by-depression01.png)

<div class="notes">

Here is the plot. The order of the weeks is not correct, because week12 appears between week0 and week3. 

There are several ways to fix this.

</div>

### Boxplot

```{r modified-boxplot}
qu_tall$time[qu_tall$time=="Week0"] <- "Week00"
qu_tall$time[qu_tall$time=="Week3"] <- "Week03"
qu_tall$time[qu_tall$time=="Week6"] <- "Week06"
qu_tall$time[qu_tall$time=="Week9"] <- "Week09"
depression_boxplot02 <- ggplot(qu_tall, aes(x=time, y=depression)) +
  geom_boxplot()
ggsave(
  "../images/time-by-depression02.png", 
  depression_boxplot02, width=4, height=4)
```

<div class="notes">

An easy way to fix this is to use two numeric digits, even for weeks that have only a single digit.

</div>

### Boxplot

![Modified boxplots showing depression levels over time](../images/time-by-depression02.png)

<div class="notes">

Here are the boxplots in the proper order. There are changes in depression levels across time, but these changes are small.
