This module discusses how to handle datasets that have mostly continuous variables. These are the simplest datasets and represent a reasonable starting point. 

## Learning objectives

In these videos you will learn how to

+ install R and RStudio
+ organize a directory structure
+ write and run a small R program

## Videos

There are two required videos for this module.

+ V01-01. A simple program (20 minutes)
  + The slides and speaker notes for this video can be found [here](http://www.pmean.com/introduction-to-r/results/v01-slides-and-speaker-notes.pdf).
+ General video. Good documentation (25 minutes)
  + The slides and speaker notes for this video are not yet available.

Go to the Canvas website to view these videos.

## Datasets used in this module

There is one dataset used in this module. It is stored in a single binary file, which you can download [here](../dat/module01-datasets.RData). You should not need the text version of the file, but I am including links to them below.

### bump

+ View the [data dictionary](../dat/airline-data-dictionary.txt)
+ Used in the video
+ Not needed for the homework assignment
+ A [text version](../dat/airline-bumping-2017.txt) of this dataset.

## Assignments

### D01-01. Introduce yourself

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after the deadline.

Tell us about yourself. What degree program you are in, why you are taking this class, and what you are hoping to do when you graduate.

Optionally, include a picture of yourself and tell us about one of your hobbies.

### D01-02. Feedback after viewing videos

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after the due date.

Review the videos in this section and answer the following questions.

1. What was the most important thing you learned.

2. What did you find confusing.

3. What would you like to see covered next.

It is okay to use short answers like "Nothing was confusing" or "Everything was confusing." You can also briefly concur with a previous student's comments.

### HW01. Adapt the small program to run on your computer.

Graded: 3 points, one point deducted if submitted late.

Download the code for [small-program.Rmd](../src/small-program.Rmd) and the datafile two-small-dataframes.RData(../data/two-small-dataframes.RData) and store the files in a src and data directory somewhere on your computer. Modify the code so that you are listed as the author. Run the program and submit it as a PDF file.

If there are errors or warnings in your output, make your best effort to fix them, but getting anything to run, even something with error messages will be sufficient for this very first homework assignment.
