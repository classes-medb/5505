This module discusses how to hande datasets that have mostly continuous variables. These are the simplest datasets and represent a reasonable starting point. The module reviews for you the general structure of an Rmarkdown file and uses a simple dataset to show how to display various parts of a dataset. Then you will see work with a larger dataset showing how to detect outliers, create and handle a missing value, and produce descriptive statistics, histograms, correlations, and scatterplots.

There are three datasets used in this module. All of these are stored in a single binary file, which you can download [here](../dat/module02-datasets.RData).
